    "# ExcelDataProcessor Class Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The `ExcelDataProcessor` class is designed to process Excel files containing data with Persian calendar dates. It provides functionality to read multiple Excel files, extract specific cell values, and organize the data into a sorted DataFrame based on Persian calendar dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "- Reads both regular Excel files (.xls, .xlsx) and HTML-formatted Excel files\n",
    "- Handles Persian calendar dates in column names\n",
    "- Converts string values to float type\n",
    "- Supports tuple-based column names (common in multi-index Excel files)\n",
    "- Sorts data based on Persian calendar dates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__init__(data_directory='data')`\n",
    "Initializes the processor with a specified data directory.\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `data_directory` (str): Path to the directory containing Excel files (default: 'data')\n",
    "\n",
    "### `read_excel_files()`\n",
    "Reads all Excel files from the specified directory.\n",
    "- **Returns:**\n",
    "  - `bool`: True if files were successfully read, False otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "### `get_cell_values(row_idx, col_idx)`\n",
    "Extracts values from specific row and column indices across all files.\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `row_idx` (int): Row index\n",
    "  - `col_idx` (int): Column index\n",
    "- **Returns:**\n",
    "  - `pd.DataFrame`: DataFrame with columns:\n",
    "    - Filename: Name of the Excel file\n",
    "    - Value: Numeric value from the specified cell\n",
    "    - Date: Formatted Persian date\n",
    "    - Column_Detail: Second part of tuple column name (if available)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an instance\n",
    "processor = ExcelDataProcessor(data_directory='data')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read all Excel files\n",
    "if processor.read_excel_files():\n",
    "    # Get values from row 1, column 13\n",
    "    result_df = processor.get_cell_values(1, 13)\n",
    "    print(result_df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Format\n",
    "The resulting DataFrame will be sorted by Persian calendar dates and include:\n",
    "- Files with valid dates sorted in chronological order\n",
    "- Files with unknown dates placed at the end\n",
    "- All numeric values converted to float type\n",
    "- Additional column details when available"
